  <main id="main-content" class="wrapper flow"><h1>Issue 18 - Bits &amp; pieces</h1>
<p>This week's issue is going to be a different from the usual format. Rather than focusing on one single topic, I'll be sharing a few web perf related news articles that have popped up over the last couple of weeks. It'll be a bit shorter than usual, but there'll be plenty of further reading for you to dive into!</p>
<hr>
<h2>Web Vitals. Core Web Vitals.</h2>
<p>It's almost mid-June, and that means Google will soon start applying Core Web Vitals (CWV) to search rankings. Leading up to this, different teams at Google have put out some related updates.</p>
<h3><a href="https://web.dev/cls-web-tooling/">An update for Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</a></h3>
<p>Unlike other Web Vital metrics which are measured on page load, CLS is tracked over the entire duration of a page view. The new CLS calculation accumulates only the worst 'windows' of layout shifts regardless of the time spent on a page.</p>
<p>On top of this, CLS will now also have a higher weighting in Lighthouse performance scoring (bumping up from 5% to 15%). That being said, Google expects that most sites will see no change to their CLS scores.</p>
<h3>GoogleIO featured several Web Vitals related talks</h3>
<p>There were also a few Web Vital related talks during the recent GoogleIO summit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxvHY4wC8Co"><strong>What's new in Web Vitals</strong></a><br>
This session goes through some of the changes Google's made to Web Vitals recently, including the aforementioned CLS update.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPmAE0YjGK0"><strong>The business impact of Core Web Vitals</strong></a><br>
Here's a handy session for anyone trying to convince their manager, executives, or clients about the benefits that can come from focusing on Core Web Vitals.</p>
<h2>Lighthouse 8.0 has been rolled out</h2>
<p>Google's also started rolling out Lighthouse 8.0 across its performance measuring properties. Lighthouse is a set of audits that can be run against a web page to measure performance, accessibility, technical SEO and other best practices. It's available in the browser, as a Node/CLI tool,  and is also integrated into many performance measuring services.</p>
<p>DebugBear has a handy <a href="https://www.debugbear.com/blog/lighthouse-v8"><strong>rundown of everything new</strong></a> in the latest version. The highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CLS update metioned above is included in this update.</li>
<li>CLS now accounts of 15% of the total performance score.</li>
<li>There's handy filters that let you isolate audit results based on the Core Web Vital they impact.</li>
<li>A JavaScript treemap and code coverage report provides a visual way to assess where JS improvements can be made.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can check out the tree map &amp; filters by running a test on <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/"><strong>PageSpeed Insight</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>WebP support is coming to WordPress</h2>
<p>This is big. WordPress powers over 40% of websites. Being able to upload, and hopefully also convert images to WebP natively should be a huge improvement for a lot of sites. Here's the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/07/wordpress-5-8-adds-webp-support/"><strong>official announcement</strong></a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The next issue of Optimised will be in your inbox on June 25th. The website has anÂ <strong><a href="https://optimised.email/">archive of all previous emails</a></strong>. It's a good place to recap on anything we've covered, and also handy to share with friends or colleagues.</p>
<p>As always if you've got any feedback or specific topics you want to be covered then just reply to this email.</p>
<p>Keep safe, stay well.<br>
Fershad.</p>
