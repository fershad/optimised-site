<!-- # #35 - Bits & pieces -->

It’s Lunar New Year here in Taiwan. I’m down in central Taiwan for a week of eating, visiting relatives, and more eating. So, this week’s newsletter will be a short one in which I’ll share with you some of my favourite web performance related content from the past year.

Before we get into it, though, I’d like to share a couple of things. Last week I launched [aremythirdpartiesgreen.com](https://aremythirdpartiesgreen.com?utm_source=optimised), a website where you can check a web page to see what third-party resources it uses and how sustainable they are. Also, next week I’ll be speaking about web performance and sustainability at the Toronto Web Perf. Meetup. It’s online, and [everyone is welcome to join](https://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Web-Performance-Group/events/283332963/)!
