Moving apartment is pretty much done now, but as you will I've been sick for the better part of the week. Probably tried to bite off a bit too much in the hot, humid Taipei summer. So, in this week’s newsletter I’ll share with you some of my favourite articles and videos from the recent past.

<!-- # #47 - Bits & pieces -->

[Avoiding <img> layout shifts: aspect-ratio vs width & height attributes](https://jakearchibald.com/2022/img-aspect-ratio/) - Jake Archibald explains shares some handy demos and explains how `aspect-ratio` and `height` and `width` attributes work to reserve space for images when a page builds.

[Faster WordPress rendering with 3 lines of configuration](https://www.phpied.com/faster-wordpress-rendering-with-3-lines-of-configuration/) - Stoyan Stefanov shares a quick way to optimise rendering for WordPress sites, if you're brave enough to fiddle around with your site's `.htaccess` file.

[(Video) Audit using Opportunities & Experiments with Scott Jehl and Tim Kadlec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPufLGlkomo) - Scott & Tim use the new Opportunities and Experiments features in WebPageTest to do some live audits on real world sites. Worth a watch if you haven't looked into how these new features can speed up your workflow.

[(Video) Geri Coady - If Not Now, When? Turning Your Passion Project into a Reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIKWwWHrznE) - Not performance related, but I found this talk by Geri Coady at the recent beyond tellerrand conference in Dusseldorf really inspirational. Especially for those who aren't sure about making the jump into freelance, or pursuing their passion.
