This week, I made my personal website (fershad.com) "carbon aware". I wrote up a small page explaining what I'd done, and put it out into the world. Next minute, my site was getting more traffic that it normally sees in a month. The idea of carbon awareness on the web is something that seems to resonate with people, even if it might be very new.

This week, I'm doing something a bit different. Rather than dropping a whole post into your inbox, I'm going to link you back to my own site. There I've written up a short web page, and a longer more detailed post, explaining what I've done to make that site carbon aware. In that way, you might even get to experience what you're reading about.

**Short page:** <https://fershad.com/carbon-aware-site/>  
This page covers terminology, and implementation of carbon awareness on my website. It's the TL;DR version of the longer post below.

**Long post:** <https://fershad.com/writing/making-this-website-carbon-aware/>  
Here, you'll get a tonne more context, background, and thoughts from me. I go through some examples of carbon-aware digital products, how I got the idea for adding carbon awareness to my site, how I went about doing it and what considerations I made, as well as a bit of future casting on how this could become more mainstream.
