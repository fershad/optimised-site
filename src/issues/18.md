<!-- # Issue 18 - Bits & pieces -->

This week's issue is going to be a different from the usual format. Rather than focusing on one single topic, I'll be sharing a few web perf related news articles that have popped up over the last couple of weeks. It'll be a bit shorter than usual, but there'll be plenty of further reading for you to dive into!

## Web Vitals. Core Web Vitals.

It's almost mid-June, and that means Google will soon start applying Core Web Vitals (CWV) to search rankings. Leading up to this, different teams at Google have put out some related updates.

### [An update for Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)](https://web.dev/cls-web-tooling/)

Unlike other Web Vital metrics which are measured on page load, CLS is tracked over the entire duration of a page view. The new CLS calculation accumulates only the worst 'windows' of layout shifts regardless of the time spent on a page.

On top of this, CLS will now also have a higher weighting in Lighthouse performance scoring (bumping up from 5% to 15%). That being said, Google expects that most sites will see no change to their CLS scores.

### GoogleIO featured several Web Vitals related talks

There were also a few Web Vital related talks during the recent GoogleIO summit.

This session goes through some of the changes Google's made to Web Vitals recently, including the aforementioned CLS update.

Here's a handy session for anyone trying to convince their manager, executives, or clients about the benefits that can come from focusing on Core Web Vitals.

## Lighthouse 8.0 has been rolled out

Google's also started rolling out Lighthouse 8.0 across its performance measuring properties. Lighthouse is a set of audits that can be run against a web page to measure performance, accessibility, technical SEO and other best practices. It's available in the browser, as a Node/CLI tool,  and is also integrated into many performance measuring services. 

DebugBear has a handy [**rundown of everything new**](https://www.debugbear.com/blog/lighthouse-v8) in the latest version. The highlights:

- The CLS update metioned above is included in this update.
- CLS now accounts of 15% of the total performance score.
- There's handy filters that let you isolate audit results based on the Core Web Vital they impact.
- A JavaScript treemap and code coverage report provides a visual way to assess where JS improvements can be made.

You can check out the tree map & filters by running a test on [**PageSpeed Insight**](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/).

## WebP support is coming to WordPress

This is big. WordPress powers over 40% of websites. Being able to upload, and hopefully also convert images to WebP natively should be a huge improvement for a lot of sites. Here's the [**official announcement**](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/07/wordpress-5-8-adds-webp-support/).
